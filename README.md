In this project we created a new portfolio from sctrach.

i started this project by first mapping the layout and figuring out what I need to do. from there i wrtoe the html and followed by css.

overall I am happy with the way this turnd out, i consider this a rough draft of my final portfolio.

this project helped me to put togeather many things learned in class and use them.


GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
